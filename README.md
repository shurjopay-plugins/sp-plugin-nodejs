## Audience

This document is intended for the developers and technical personnel of merchants and service providers who want to integrate the shurjoPay online payment gateway using python.

## How to use this shurjoPay Plugin

#### Use `npm` to install this plugin inside your project environment.

```
npm install shurjopay
```

#### Create a .env file inside your project's root directory. Here is a sample .env configuration.

```
SP_USERNAME=sp_sandbox
SP_PASSWORD=pyyk97hu&6u6
SP_PREFIX=sp
DEFAULT_CURRENCY=BDT
```

#### After that, you can initiate payment request to shurjoPay using our package the way you want based on your application. Here we are providing a basic example code snippet for you.

```JavaScript
require("dotenv").config();
const shurjopay = require("shurjopay")();
// shurjopay.is_live();  # Needed for live environment
// NOTE: Do not call is_live() function when you are using the sandbox environment

with(process.env){
  shurjopay.configure_merchant(
    SP_USERNAME,
    SP_PASSWORD,
    SP_PREFIX,
    DEFAULT_CURRENCY
  );
}
```

```JavaScript

shurjopay.checkout({
      "amount":1000,
      "order_id":"nx10t1",
      "return_url": "https://sandbox.shurjopayment.com/response",
      "cancel_url": "https://sandbox.shurjopayment.com/response",
      "customer_name":"Shanto",
      "customer_address":"Mohakhali",
      "client_ip": "102.324.0.5",
      "customer_phone":"01517162394",
      "customer_city":"Dhaka",
      "customer_post_code":"1229",
},
(response_data) => {
  // TODO Handle response from shurjopay and update your system
  // NOTE 'checkout_url' in response_data can be used to redirect consumers to shurjopay landing page
},
(error) => {
  // TODO Handle error response
});

```

#### Payment verification can be done after each transaction with shurjopay order id.

```JavaScript

shurjopay.verify(order_id, (response_data) => {
  // TODO Handle response from shurjopay and update your system
},
(error) => {
  // TODO Handle error response
});

```

#### That's all! Now you are ready to use the nodejs plugin to seamlessly integrate with shurjoPay to make your payment system easy and smooth.
